Transmission routes of antibiotic resistant bacteria: a systematic review

Code for the systematic review by Godijk et al. on transmission routes of antibiotic resistant bacteria

We wrote this code in R version 3.6.1 and R studio. Please be sure that you installed these programmes on your computer.  

One branch contains the data of all the studies and code for all the meta-analysis. This branch has its own readme file.
One branch contains graphs created showing the risk and odds ratios for travelling to regions all over the world. These graphs can only be used when citing the systematic review of Godijk et al. These graphs are not allowed to be modified.

Good luck!
